    "mlvtrans is a python package that implements the algorithm explained in Appendix C of the paper [Logical Clifford gates with multilevel transversality](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=hIPtQG8AAAAJ&hl=ja). For any self-dual quantum CSS code which satisfies certain conditions (see Theorem 1. in [Logical Clifford gates with multilevel transversality](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=hIPtQG8AAAAJ&hl=ja)), mlvtrans constructs a compatible symplectic basis, which is a symplectic basis such that (1) transversal logical Hadamard gates $\\bigotimes_{j=1}^{k} \\bar{H}_j$ can be implemented by transversal physical Hadamard gates $\\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} H_i$, and (2) for any $(a_1,\\dots,a_k)\\in\\{-1,1\\}^k$, transversal logical phase-type gates $\\bigotimes_{j=1}^{k} \\bar{S}_j^{a_j}$ can be implemented by transversal physical phase-type gates $\\bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} S_i^{b_i}$ for some $(b_1,\\dots,b_n)\\in\\{-1,1\\}^n$. mlvtrans also outputs such $(b_1,\\dots,b_n)\\in\\{-1,1\\}^n$ for any choice of $(a_1,\\dots,a_k)\\in\\{-1,1\\}^k$."

    "The hexagonal color code is a clear example of a code that, despite having stabilizers that are not doubly-even, can implement logical phase-type gates via transversal physical phase-type gates. Here, we input the code by specifying indices, using a function `convert_index_to_matrix(num_qubit, num_logical_qubits, h_indices, a_indices, logical_S_dict)`. With this function, you can define a parity check matrix and a set of coset representatives by specifying the indices corresponding to the 1 entries in them, as well as the indices of the logical qubits on which $\\bar{S}^\\dagger$ gates are intended to act. This function might be particularly useful when it is painful to explicitly type `np.array` for large-size codes."
