# mlvtrans

mlvtrans is a python package that implements the algorithm explained in Appendix C of the paper [Logical Clifford gates with multilevel transversality](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=hIPtQG8AAAAJ&hl=ja). For any self-dual quantum CSS code which satisfies certain conditions (see Theorem 1. in [Logical Clifford gates with multilevel transversality](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=hIPtQG8AAAAJ&hl=ja)), mlvtrans constructs a compatible symplectic basis, which is a symplectic basis such that (1) transversal logical Hadamard gates can be implemented by transversal physical Hadamard gates and (2) any combination of transversal logical phase-type gates can be implemented by a combination of transversal physical phase-type gates. For any combination of transversal logical phase-type gates, mlvtrans also outputs a corresponding combination of transversal physical phase-type gates. $\bar{S}$
